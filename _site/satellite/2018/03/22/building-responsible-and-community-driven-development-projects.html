<p><strong>Panel discussion</strong></p>

<p>Gentrification and displacement are longstanding and underlying issues in Chicago. While they are persistent, they often flare up when there are large proposed developments, or when public investment is used to build what end up becoming popular amenities. The 606 (and similar, proposed trails), transit oriented development, school closings, and the forthcoming Obama Presidential Center, are grabbing headlines currently.</p>

The majority of Dr. Smith’s research and outreach activities are conducted in partnership with community organizations and policy stakeholders through the UIC Voorhees Center. She has led several large-scale housing research projects in Chicago including a regional homeless needs assessment and a rental market study funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Along with Larry Bennett and Patricia Wright (former Voorhees director), Smith co-edited and co-authored Where are Poor People to Live? Transforming Public Housing Communities (ME Sharpe 2006). She and John Betancur recently published Claiming Neighborhood: New Ways of Understanding Urban Change (University of Illinois 2016).</p>
