<p>Yesterday, the Chi Hack Night had our first ever <a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/2015/09/22/community-feedback-session.html">community feedback session</a>.</p>

<p>The Chi Hack Night has grown and changed a lot over the last 3 ½ years, and we wanted to take the time and hear from everyone on how it’s going, and how we can make it better.</p>

<p>To handle our large group (there were about 70 people in attendance), we broke out into four groups, led by <a href="https://twitter.com/gennielsen">Genevieve Nielsen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rosesafriyie">Rose Afriyie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cthydng">Cathy Deng</a> and <a href="http://red-bean.com/kfogel/">Karl Fogel</a>, to provide feedback on the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What do you like about Chi Hack Night?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would you like to learn from this community?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What kinds of presentations should would you like to see?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What could we do differently or better with this community?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each group went to a whiteboard with a topic written at the top and given sticky notes to write their ideas under each one. After 5 minutes, the groups would rotate and move on to the next topic.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><img src="/images/blog/2015-09-23-results-of-our-community-feedback-session/image2.jpg" alt="Four groups providing feedback on four topics" class="img-thumbnail" /></p>

    <small><em>Four groups providing feedback on four topics</em></small><br /><br />
</div>

<p>Ideas that people liked were given +1’s. Some folks got creative and started categorizing the feedback into sub-sections. Is there a library scientist in our group?</p>

<p>At the end, we reported back out the feedback.</p>

<p>Here’s a video of the group reporting, courtesy of Christopher Whitaker and Smart Chicago:</p>

<p>The full list of feedback, along with some next steps we plan on taking are recorded in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mlVH4e17v3tBMW5WCrMejKjGr5TPyVrVvpiungpuuQ8/edit#">Open Leadership Council notes</a>.

    <small><em>Proccessing the feedback at the Open Leadership Council meeting</em></small><br /><br />
</div>

<p>The biggest takeaway from this feedback is that people really appreciate the community we’ve built here. As the leader of this group, it looks like we’re doing a lot of things right. It’s validating to hear.</p>

<p>But we can always improve, and we have some really compelling directions to go in over the next months and years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue to keep our structure as community and work-driven, meeting every week at the same time and place.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a good diversity of people and skills, but we can and will continue to reach out to new groups and communities. We will continue to nurture open and welcoming attitudes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our community seems to have a real interest in social issues. We will continue to seek out more presentations in this vein, like <a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/2015/07/07/social-strategies-in-chicago-activism.html">Social Strategies in Chicago Activism</a>, <a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/2015/04/21/american-civil-liberties-union-of-illinois.html">The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois</a> and <a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/2015/07/28/reporting-on-poverty-and-school-achievement.html">Reporting on Poverty and School Achievement</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will continue to push for more learning opportunities and skill sharing. Chi Hack Night has become a place to learn as much as it is a place to work on civic tech projects.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There’s much more to process, but we’ll start there.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for participating, and see you next Tuesday!</p>
