<p><strong>Why did you join Chi Hack Night?</strong></p>

<p>I joined hack night because I believe in making an ongoing commitment to gather with people who care deeply about making a local impact. I also value that a space exists where people can gather and contribute expertise in data science, computer programming, and other superpowers.</p>

<p><strong>What are you presenting at the Summit?</strong></p>

<p>I’m presenting on <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/#breakout_138">using human centered design to improve social service delivery</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you interested in meeting?</strong></p>

<p>I’m really excited to connect with 18F about Privacy and Civic Technology Projects. I’m also thrilled to meet folks at Gov.UK because their screening tools are first rate in the industry.</p>

<p><strong>What would you like to brag about?</strong></p>

<p>I’m also excited to announce that their <a href="http://mrelief.com">mRelief</a> tool which helps program providers customize screeners for their community has gone into Private Beta. They encourage thought leaders in civic technology to request an invite at <a href="http://beta.mrelief.com">beta.mrelief.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What is your favorite Chicago food?</strong>
 
Vegan Cocoa Mousse Cake custom made at the Chicago Diner. It is a must-eat if you are ever in the city.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you join Chi Hack Night?</strong></p>

<p>I joined Chi Hack Night because I dig cross-pollination! There are so many interdisciplinary conversations &amp; projects happening at any given time.</p>

<p><strong>What are you presenting at the Summit?</strong></p>

<p>Open source tech is great in theory, but I thinks that in reality, open source projects are too-often intimidating &amp; confusing. My workshop (Wed 2-3pm) will focus on how new folks can make sense of open source projects &amp; how maintainers can be more welcoming to a wider audience.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you interested in meeting?</strong></p>

<p>Folks who dig information design, folks who are working on something playful/creative, and folks who want to reflect on civic tech failures.</p>

<p><strong>What would you like to brag about?</strong></p>

<p>This is my second year speaking at the summit - last year I talked about <a href="https://youtu.be/CerCresA9mo">my work on Expunge.io</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite Chicago food?</strong></p>

<p>My least favorite Chicago food is deep dish “pizza” &amp; my favorite is Mario’s Italian Lemonade.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you join Chi Hack Night?</strong></p>

<p>I was already active in local politics and studying public administration when I joined Chi Hack Night. I am and remain very curious about organizational functions in government and how government could operate more effectively.</p>

<p>Chi Hack Night sucked me in first with interesting presentations related to civic hacking and engagement and effective tools for individuals and agencies. Then, I started getting involved in the various working groups, applying my current skillset and learning new skills.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you interested in meeting?</strong></p>

<p>I would love to meet any fellow GIS/Geography/Data Science people.</p>

<p><strong>What would you like to brag about?</strong></p>

<p>About two months ago I started working full time as a self-employed consultant. I’m learning a ton while doing some interesting work!</p>

<p><strong>Why did you join Chi Hack Night?</strong></p>

<p>I joined Hack Night back in the day, when I was a young bureaucrat at Chicago Public Schools. I noticed on Twitter that a group I had never heard of had produced a lovely map to help parents, students, teachers navigate the school system — way better than the maps CPS offered on their website at the time! I simply had to find out who these Hack Night people were.</p>

<p><strong>Who are you interested in meeting?</strong></p>

<p>All the new Chi Hack Night folks I haven’t met since I’ve been in the Bay Area!  </p>

<p>I attended hack nights with four different Brigades this year: Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, and Oakland. Meeting civic tech people across the country is fun and learning what everyone is up to is inspiring. </p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite Chicago food?</strong></p>

<p>The one with the endless layers of meat and cheese.</p>
