<small><em>Chi Hack Night, July 28 2015</em></small>
</p>

<p>It’s the end of the year, and time to reflect on all the amazing things we accomplished in 2015 at the Chi Hack Night, Chicago’s place to build, share and learn about civic tech.</p>

<p>Our community has never been as large, as diverse, as engaged and as productive as it is now. We have a lot to be proud of.</p>

<p>To start things off, here’s some data about Chi Hack Night for 2015:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We hosted <strong>48</strong> events. This is what we do. We meet at the same time and place every week.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had <strong>37</strong> presentations on topics covering Chicago Public Schools, predicting food inspections, social strategies in Chicago activism, cryptography and more! See the list of our favorites below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Largest audience: <strong>152</strong> attendees. A new record is set! The <a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/2014/07/08/data-science-for-social-good.html">Data Science for Social Good</a> presentation drew the largest crowd this year (pictured above), beating our old record of 120 in 2014.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have <strong>160</strong> Slack members. This year, we launched our own <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> community so that we could keep our discussions going from week to week. Want to join? You’ll have to come to a Chi Hack Night!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have <strong>1,300</strong> email subscribers. Our email list continues to grow! <a href="http://eepurl.com/z65hn">Sign up for it</a> to hear about new events, talk about new projects, civic tech wins, and job postings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We ate <strong>2,400</strong> empanadas. After many many years of many many deep dish pizzas, we have switched over to empanadas from local Costa Rican joint, <a href="http://www.irazuchicago.com/">Irazu</a>. So yummy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-in-2015">New in 2015</h2>

<p><strong>Open Gov Hack Night becomes Chi Hack Night</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/logo/logo.png" alt="Chi Hack Night" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>Since we started 3 ½ years and 185 events ago, our event has grown into a community all its own. We emerged out of the<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/08/chicago-data-apps-open-government.html"> Open Government movement</a> here in Chicago, and have become something much more.</p>

<p>We’re not just about Open Gov anymore. We’re about all things technology and civics in <em>Chicago.</em> This includes govtech, digital access, data journalism, community building and modern activism, just to name a few.</p>

<p>And we’ve got t-shirts and stickers now too!</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Braintree is our new home</strong></p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, <a href="http://braintreepayments.com/">Braintree</a>  offered us the use of their auditorium and conference room area <em>for free</em>. It’s not every day you get offered one of the premier meeting spaces in Chicago for $0! Braintree, an online payment processor, is a bright spot in the Chicago technology scene and supports not only the Chi Hack Night, but various other technology meetups in Chicago.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><img src="/images/blog/2015-11-23-10-lessons-from-organizing-the-chi-hack-night/img0.jpg" alt="Enjoying the Braintree auditorium!" class="img-thumbnail" /><br />

    <small><em>Enjoying the Braintree auditorium!</em></small><br /><br /></p>
</div>

<p>With the Braintree space, we’re able to take advantage of their sprawling space including cafeteria area, conference rooms, and auditorium. At our largest event, we were able to fit almost 150 people <em>comfortably</em> - which makes a huge difference.</p>

<p>A huge thanks to Adam Forsyth for inviting us, and the rest of the wonderful staff at Braintree!</p>

<p><strong>Community Feedback Session</strong></p>

<p>As the Chi Hack Night has grown, our community has changed. We’re not just 4 nerds sitting around a table anymore, and it’s important to hear from everyone if they have feedback to give.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <p><img src="/images/blog/2015-09-23-results-of-our-community-feedback-session/image1.jpg" alt="Community Feedback Session at the Chi Hack Night" class="img-thumbnail" /><br />

    <small><em>Community Feedback Session at the Chi Hack Night</em></small><br /><br /></p>
</div>

<p>To facilitate this, we held our first <a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/2015/09/22/community-feedback-session.html">community feedback session</a> in September. Over 70 people participated and <a href="http://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/09/23/results-of-our-community-feedback-session.html">provided some amazing feedback</a> on what we’re doing right, and what can be done better.</p>

<p><strong>Dev Bootcamp and Microsoft join as a recurring sponsors</strong></p>

<p>As a volunteer-run organization, the Chi Hack Night relies on the contributions of both our attendees, and our sponsors. Them empanadas ain’t free!</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2015-12-22-chi-hack-night-2015-year-in-review/devbootcamp-logo.png" alt="Dev Bootcamp" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>We were thrilled to have <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> join as a recurring sponsor in April. Several members of the Chi Hack Night have since enrolled at Dev Bootcamp to level up their development skills, and many of their graduates have become hack night regulars. That’s what I call a virtuous cycle!</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2015-12-22-chi-hack-night-2015-year-in-review/msft_logo.png" alt="Microsoft" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>We’re also happy to announce that starting in 2016 <a href="http://microsoft-chicago.com/">Microsoft</a> will become a recurring sponsor. A big shout-out to <a href="http://microsoft-chicago.com/author/adam/">Adam Hecktman</a> for making it happen!</p>

<p>And a huge thank you to our former partners The <a href="http://smartchicagocollaborative.org/">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a> and <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> for supporting us over the years. The Chi Hack Night wouldn’t be what it is today without them!</p>

<p><strong>New breakout leaders emerge</strong></p>

<p>In 2014, we rolled out a new volunteer organizing model: <a href="http://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html">breakout groups</a>. Anyone is welcome to start their own group. Every week, the groups are pitched and people join the ones that interest them the most.</p>

<p>Not only has this model turned out to be a great way to organize volunteers with diverse skillsets, it also allows new people to step up and become leaders themselves.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the emerging leaders from 2015:</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p><img src="/images/people/mary_kuhn.png" alt="Mary Kuhn" title="Mary Kuhn" class="img-responsive img-rounded" /></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">

        <p><strong>Mary Kuhn, Dolphin Tank</strong></p>

        <p>Dolphin Tank is a friendly place to pitch civic tech app ideas and get honest feedback on its viability and guidance on how to prototype it. It’s like Shark Tank, but nicer. Mary pioneered this group in July and it became an instant hit!<br /><br /></p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p><img src="/images/people/kulsum_ameji.jpg" alt="Kulsum Ameji" title="Kulsum Ameji" class="img-responsive img-rounded" /></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p><strong>Kulsum Ameji, Access to Justice / Hack Night Taxi Project</strong></p>

        <p>Kulsum is an attorney, trainer, speaker and strategist at the Legal Aid Foundation. She brings a ton of expertise from both the legal and social sectors.</p>

        <p>At the Chi Hack Night, she decided to focus on the negative impacts of the sharing economy and finding out what are the implications for low-wage workers who exist in the contradictory space between traditional, highly regulated systems and new, “disruptive” economic systems.<br /><br /></p>
    </div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-2">
        <p><img src="/images/people/tom_schenk_jr.jpg" alt="Tom Schenk Jr" title="Tom Schenk Jr" class="img-responsive img-rounded" /></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p><strong>Tom Schenk Jr, Beach Water Quality</strong></p>
        <p>Tom is a veteran of the hack night, but his recently formed breakout group is new and very exciting. As Chicago’s Chief Data Officer, Tom is leading a new partnership between the City of Chicago and the Chi Hack Night to improve the statistical model is used to predict the E. coli levels at Chicago’s beaches. Not only is the project endorsed by the City, they’re <a href="https://github.com/Chicago/e-coli-beach-predictions">building it 100% in the open</a>.<br /><br /></p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-10">
        <p><strong>Fabian Elliott and Corey Thurman, Black Tech Mecca</strong></p>
        <p>Through Black Tech Mecca, Fabian and Corey are striving to transform Chicago into, you guessed it, the black technology Mecca.</p>
        <p>After <a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/2015/09/08/black-tech-mecca.html">presenting in September</a>, they started a breakout group to build a community platform to strengthen connections within the black tech community and collect data to evaluate health of ecosystem.<br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="presentation-highlights">2015 presentation highlights</h2>

<p>37 presentations is a lot (<a href="http://chihacknight.org/events/">see the full list here</a>), and it’s a real challenge to pick our favorites. We can try, though:</p>

<p>Olatunji Oboi Reed from<a href="http://slowrollchicago.org/"> Slow Roll Chicago</a> told us a very moving and personal story and how bicycling literally saved his life.

<p><a href="http://publiclab.org/profile/bsugar">Benjamin Sugar</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/obauti">Olga Bautista</a> told an amazing story how a coalition of community organizations and area residents employed an aerial<a href="http://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping"> balloon mapping kit</a> to help <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/27/chicago-petcoke-koch-brothers_n_6755040.html%0A%0A">oust open air petcoke facilities</a> from of their neighborhood in Chicago’s Southeast side.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.red-bean.com/kfogel/">Karl Fogel</a> of<a href="http://opentechstrategies.com/"> Open Tech Strategies, LLC</a> and open source fame offered some sobering examples of how merely republishing open data or publicly available information can lead to ethically uncomfortable situations.

<p><a href="http://www.adler.edu/page/faculty/dan-cooper-ms">Dan Cooper</a> discussed his research on the impact of incarceration at the neighborhood level and <a href="https://twitter.com/cthydng">Cathy Deng</a> gave some practical tips on the process of transforming raw materials — data &amp; text — into an interactive story on the web.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sskedreporter">Sarah Karp</a>, Senior Investigator for the Better Government Association, blew our minds with her groundbreaking investigations, and her humility. She walked us through breaking the<a href="http://catalyst-chicago.org/2013/07/20-million-no-bid-contract-raises-questions-about-supes-academy/"> Barbara Byrd-Bennett / Supes Academy corruption story in 2013</a> and how she uncovered<a href="http://www.wbez.org/news/emanuel-touts-bogus-graduation-rate-112163"> rampant cheating in the Chicago Public Schools graduation rate</a>.</p>

<p>We learned all about practical tools to encrypt our data from <a href="https://twitter.com/redshiftzero">Jennifer Helsby</a> at<a href="https://twitter.com/CryptopartyChi"> Cryptoparty Chicago</a>. Jennifer gave a wonderful talk about why understanding digital security is so important, what goes on at a digital security training, and where to begin when thinking about privacy issues.</p>

<p>We went out with a bang for our last talk of the year. <a href="http://aast.uic.edu/aast/people/faculty/david-stovall">Dr. Dave Stovall</a>, Professor of African American Studies and Educational Policy Studies at UIC, covered his work doing youth participatory action research in the context of decades of institutional racism in Chicago. You have to watch the talk to fully appreciate both his style and substance.</p>
