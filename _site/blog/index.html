        <p>On May 8th, 2018 we celebrated the 300th episode of Chi Hack Night! In honor of this momentous milestone, we recognized the many people, projects, partners, and presentations that make our community great. The evening included the awarding of “the Hackies”, our new civic tech version of the Oscars! 13 Hackies were awarded by popular vote.</p>

        <p>On March 10, 2018, a cadre of journalists, civic tech folks, and other interested people gathered in a room at the Marriott Magnificent Mile to discuss the relationship of civic tech and data journalism. Derek Eder and I were to facilitate the discussion at this session, which was called “Civic Tech and Data Journalism: Better Together.” We didn’t include a period on the end of the title, but for us it was implied – it was a statement of fact. However, we soon found, just minutes into the discussion, that, for many in the group, the title should have ended in a question mark.</p>

        <p>This guide is for people who are concerned about use of their data by social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and Google and its effect on themselves and the world. Though Facebook is emphasized in the guide, most of these steps and principles can be applied to just about any web platform.</p>

        <p>Chicago’s Clear Water Project is an effort to keep beaches safe through a combination of new water testing technologies, predictive modeling, and continued volunteer engagement. Based on its pilot run in 2017, the Clear Water Project method was able to issue water quality advisories with three times more accuracy than Chicago’s previous method.</p>

        <p>For our 250th hack night, we asked for presentations along the theme of 5 years forward / 5 years back. We also wanted to open up the format a bit and encourage other kinds of performances, including talks, poems, songs and skits.</p>

        <p>Working in newspapers was an education in civics, and in hacking. Chi Hack Night helped me put the two together. As Chi Hack Night marks its 5th anniversary this week, its role in Chicago’s tech community and civic life , and I’m personally grateful for its endurance.</p>

        <p>On December 13th 2016, Chi Hack Night hosted our last event of the year: The Chi Hack Night Holiday Party Hacktacular. Eight members of the Chi Hack Night community shared their own story or insight about civics, society and technology. The major themes this time around were the needs, tactics and benefits of inclusion, perspective on our community’s role in society, and the responsibilities that we have as users of data.</p>

        <p>Oct 14-15, 2016 was Transparency Camp in Cleveland, Ohio - and Chi Hack Night was there to represent Chicago! As advocates of transparency and open government, it’s only natural that members of Chi Hack Night decided to attend. With Cleveland a 5-6 hour drive away, we decided to make a road trip out of it! We rented a van and hit the road.</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, September 13th 2016, three analysts from the United States Government Accountability Office presented at Chi Hack Night to describe the data-intensive nature of their work assessing our federal government’s efficiency to a crowd of over 100 people. Presenters Rebecca Abela, Silvia Ellis, and Joanie Lofgren all work in the GAO’s Chicago office, one of 11 offices across the country.</p>

        <p>There is a lot of talk at Chi Hack Night right now about being inclusive. Truly including people means learning to appreciate the things they enjoy, the ways they express themselves, their style. If you don’t like the way women sound and socialize and approach professional life, maybe you…don’t really like women.</p>

Though there was no defined theme or coordination among the presenters, all 9 talks ended up focusing on the topics of empathy, inclusion and progress.</p>

        <p>Chicago is piloting an analytical model to enhance its Park District’s regular beach water quality inspection process. The model, which was built entirely by a team of volunteers from Chicago’s civic tech community, aims to predict which beaches may need to close based on likely E. Coli contamination.</p>

        <p>Chicago has some extremely treacherous sidewalks, curbs and cross ways that have the potential of doing great bodily injury to those with disabilities. To help with this problem, Steven Luker submitted an app to the Center for Neighborhood Technology Urban Sustainability App Competition this weekend to allow users to report, see, and route around bad sidewalks.</p>

        <p>It was a dark and stormy night. As I trudged through the downpour on the old steel bridge across the Chicago River, I was excited that we had finally reached a breakthrough. For months we had been developing the perfect formula, better than any government or nonprofit throughout the land, for using public data to rate nursing homes.</p>

        <p>April 12th, 2016 marked our 200th Chi Hack Night! From our humble beginnings on March 22nd, 2012 as 4 nerds sitting around a table eating macaroni, to this week with 130 people from across the city from all manner of backgrounds, skillsets and neighborhoods, we have come a long, long way. Here’s what happened at Chi Hack Night 200.</p>

        <p>In both his State of the Union and his remarks at #SXSW, Chicagoan and President Barack Obama stated that the most important office in a democracy was that of the Office of the Citizen. At Chi Hack Night, we’re privileged to be part of an active movement of people getting engaged in their communities through the use of technology.</p>

        <p>I’ve been attending Chicago Hack Night events for at least 2 years and I’m writing this article to help celebrate their 200th weekly gathering. This image is from May 29, 2016, where the Heartland Alliance presented information. You can see me in the middle, sitting by the wall. That’s my usual spot. Helps me see better.</p>

        <p>It was September 2012, and I was reading a description for the Reinventing Chicago event at CNT (Center for Neighborhood Technology) the following month. The cost was $100, which isn’t a huge amount of money, but not exactly pocket change, at least not for me. But just as I was about to enter my payment information, I noticed that hackathon participants could attend for free. Even though I had no idea what a hackathon was, I figured, it was a weekend. How bad could it be?</p>

        <p>I don’t code or design or project manage or map. I am a writer. And an improviser. And sometimes a marketer. And I read a lot of books. Despite that, I have felt so welcome. More importantly, I’ve realized how every problem is interdisciplinary and we need everyone on board—everyone from all backgrounds— to solve them.</p>

        <p>On Feb 23rd 2016, Joel Inwood hosted a one-time breakout session at Chi Hack Night to discuss lean and feedback-centric methods of promoting your civic app. Three participants had their own project that needed some exposure, each of which is described below in the form of a case study that may provide some inspiration. We have generalized some guerilla marketing methods at the end that you should be able to apply to your own project.</p>

        <p>The Chi Hack Night will be sending 13 members of our community to the Code for America Summit September 30th - October 2nd, 2015. We had everyone who went answer a few questions about themselves and what they’re looking forward to at this year’s Summit. We can’t wait to meet everyone there!</p>

        <p>Yesterday, the Chi Hack Night had our first ever community feedback session. The Chi Hack Night has grown and changed a lot over the last 3 ½ years, and we wanted to take the time and hear from everyone on how it’s going, and how we can make it better. To handle our large group (there were about 70 people in attendance), we broke out into four groups, led by Genevieve Nielsen, Rose Afriyie, Cathy Deng and Karl Fogel, to provide feedback on four topics.</p>

        <p>Email wasn’t just limiting our discussion quality and member inclusion, it was also limiting file storage, file sharing, and file versioning (which file is the latest?). Email has tended to demand a lot of attention, and there’s a lot of wasted time typing responses. I wanted to use a tool that didn’t have such demands, and that helped organize responses into actionable requests and delegation.</p>

        <p>I’m happy to announce the new name and logo for our event. Since we started 3 years and 155 events ago, our event has grown into a community all it’s own. We emerged out of the Open Government movement here in Chicago, and have become something much more. We’re not just about Open Gov anymore. We’re about Chicago.</p>

        <p>At Woodstock Institute, our mission is to advance economic justice, particularly for low-wealth communities and communities of color. To move towards this goal, we prepare data concerning economic justice and empower others to use and understand it. As our national partners at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition say, data drive the movement.</p>

        <p>The flourishing of the Civic Tech movement has brought techies and citizens together, using technology to make cities more transparent and better coordinated. The movement’s strength and joy is its diversity - Chicago’s Open Gov Hack Night attracts a wide range of talents and interests each week, from web designers to database managers, data scientists, designers, business intelligence professionals, journalists, government representatives, social science researchers, non-profits and community organizers.</p>

        <p>The Open Gov Hack Night is Chicago’s weekly event to build, share, and learn about civic tech. And, boy, was it ever a place to do just that in 2014. Looking back over the last calendar year, we did a lot - too much to recount in one blog post. But I can hit the highlights!</p>

        <p>One problem organizations have faced in the past when opening up their data is that, well, the data has to remain closed. For example, data with either HIPAA or FERPA provisions is pretty much stuck in a closed state. Furthermore, many organizations are reluctant to open up certain datasets. However, all hope is not lost - this post will advance the idea of Open Source, Closed Data and present several implementation strategies.</p>

        <p>Web scraping is the task of extracting data from a website. It’s a nifty skill in any technologist’s toolkit because interesting data isn’t always accessible via an API or in a table/csv - sometimes, interesting data is just sitting on a webpage.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, more and more folks are paying attention to civic tech, seeing potential at the intersection of civics &amp; all things digital. Civic Tech Voices is a collaborative blogging experiment, of sorts, with the goal of amplifying more diverse perspectives &amp; stories in civic tech.</p>
