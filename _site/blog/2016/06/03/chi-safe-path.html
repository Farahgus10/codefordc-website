</p>

<p>Since I started using regular public transportation about 15 years ago, it
would not be an exaggeration to say that the world opened up to me. Sure,
I got family members and friends to drive me around using my van. And I
used <a href="http://www.pacebus.com/sub/paratransit/">Paratransit</a> to get around when I couldn’t get anyone else to drive me.</p>

<p>However, both options gave me very little flexibility.</p>

<p>When I rolled places myself or took public transportation, I was able to go
places when I wanted.  If a bunch of people wanted to go out for drinks or a
meal at the last moment, I was able to go.  If there was one or two encores
at a concert, I didn’t have to miss it.  If I wanted to meet a friend or pick up something at a store after work, I was able to because I didn’t have a ride waiting for me which was scheduled the previous morning.</p>

<p>I discovered something else that wasn’t as positive, though. I was <strong>seeing
how bad the sidewalks and curbs were all over Chicago</strong>. It wasn’t contained
to certain neighborhoods. Though it was far worse in some neighborhoods
as one can imagine.</p>

<p>It is not only the occasional curb which didn’t have a curb cut that made me
backtrack one or two blocks, sometimes even a mile, to find a way to cross.</p>

<p>That is just inconvenient and frustrating. It’s also the extremely treacherous sidewalks, curbs and cross ways that have the potential of doing great bodily injury.</p>

<p>I have a behemoth of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorized_wheelchair">power chair</a>. For a wheelchair, it’s considered heavy
duty with bigger front wheels and stronger frame. I also have been using
power chairs for quite a while, so I really know how to maneuver.</p>

<p>I’m very scared at times when I go places simply due to the condition of the
sidewalks and curbs.  I have tipped this bad boy over on more than one
occasion because I went off a curb the wrong way. Sometimes I was with a
group of people and they caught my chair before I hit the ground.
Sometimes I hit the ground and injured myself.  Once I sprained both of my
ankles because my chair tipped forward.</p>

<p>This is not only my experience.  When I talk to people about sidewalks and
curbs, the vast majority of the people have stories of their own. Even
people in their twenties without any visible disability were telling me that
they just were injured. Several people told me that they no longer go out
by themselves because they fear falling due to the condition of sidewalks
and curbs.</p>

<p>When they say “out”, they don’t simply mean they don’t travel
across the city themselves.  They mean they don’t go outside of their
homes by themselves.</p>

<p>They don’t roll around the neighborhood.  They
don’t go to the store a few blocks away.  They just stay inside unless they
have someone to help them if they fall over in their wheelchairs or
scooters.</p>

<p>It’s not limited to people who use wheelchairs.  People who walk
tell me that they have a lot of trouble.  One of them asked if it would be
better if he were to use a scooter to get around.  This is a guy normally
walks faster than most people I know.</p>

<h2 id="the-personal-impact-of-bad-sidewalks-and-curbs">The personal impact of Bad sidewalks and curbs</h2>

<p>Bad sidewalks and curbs have the potential of dramatically limiting what
people with mobility issues are able to do. It can affect just about every
area of life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employment</li>
  <li>School</li>
  <li>Shopping</li>
  <li>Family functions</li>
  <li>Meeting new people and enjoying a normal social life</li>
  <li>Religious life</li>
  <li>Seeing a Doctor</li>
  <li>Enjoying being outdoors</li>
  <li>Use transportation</li>
</ul>

<p>In a word, ISOLATION.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, people are often unaware that they even exist simply because
they aren’t out.</p>

<h2 id="lets-make-an-app-for-that-chi-safe-path">Let’s make an app for that: Chi Safe Path</h2>

<p>Chi Safe Path is entered in the <a href="http://www.cnt.org/urban-apps">Center for Neighborhood Technology Urban Sustainability App Competition</a> this Friday June 3rd through Sunday June 5th.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It will allow the user to report bad sidewalks, etc. to Chicago’s 311 system. You can do that actually now by phone or <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/311.html">using the city’s website</a>.</li>
  <li>The user will be able to see a map with all of the reported issues of bad sidewalks,  etc.</li>
  <li>Like Google Maps, it will hopefully give the user suggested routes for their trips within the city. Unlike Google Maps, though, it will take into account the accessibility of the sidewalks, curbs and public transportation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The app will allow the user to report issues multiple ways.  Since it’s not
always desirable to report things on the spot (i.e. no wifi, weather, in a
hurry, etc.), the user will be able to take a photo of the bad sidewalk or
curb. Using the phone’s GPS, the app will capture the location where the
photo was taken from the embedded metadata in the photo – saving the
user time and effort typing the address.  Of course, the user would still be
allowed to type the location.</p>

<p>The map will show all the reported issues giving the user a heads-up where
problematic areas are, so s/he doesn’t have any last minute surprises that
could potentially save time or more importantly avoid serious injury. The
map is a great way to prepare for that casual st/roll around a new
neighborhood or when the user doesn’t have a specific address in mind.</p>

<p>The routing feature will give the user with mobility issues a way to safely
get where s/he has to go.  It’s great for when the user is going to a specific address in Chicago.</p>

<p>The current team is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Steven Luker</li>
  <li>Patrick Sier</li>
  <li>Zane Blanton</li>
  <li>Lars Dahlberg</li>
  <li>Tom Turner</li>
</ul>

<p>We’d love your help, especially from Ruby on Rails developers and web designers! If you’re interested in helping out, <a href="steve sluker@live.com">email Steven</a>!</p>
