    <em>Reading out the results from the Chi Hack Night Post-election community feedback session on Nov 15, 2016</em>
</small>
</p>

<p>It’s the end of 2016, and time to reflect on all the amazing things we accomplished this year at Chi Hack Night.</p>

<p>We hit several milestones this year, including our 200th event, high profile presentations, asserting influence on government policy, launching our own YouTube channel, and much more.</p>

<p>Our community continues to grow, mature and diversify. We continue to play a critical role as the nexus of Chicago’s civic and technology sectors - a role that will be all the more important in coming years.</p>

<p>But first, let’s start with some high level stats about Chi Hack Night in 2016:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We hosted <strong>49 events</strong>, including our special 200th Chi Hack Night. If it’s Tuesday, it’s hack night.</li>
  <li>We had <strong><a href="#presentations">33 presentations</a></strong> from people and organizations across the government, non-profit and journalism sectors, as well as from our own community.</li>
  <li>We held our <strong><a href="#200-event">200th event celebration</a></strong> with lightning talks and guest blog posts.</li>
  <li>We circulated <strong><a href="#pledges">2 open data pledges</a></strong> and got signatures from 3 political candidates, including the new Cook County State’s Attorney, Kim Foxx.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="#projects">3 of our projects</a></strong> had a direct influence on government policy.</li>
  <li>We wrote <strong><a href="#blogs">27 blog posts</a></strong> from 15 authors advocating for issues &amp; policies, recapping presentations &amp; events, and diving into issues regarding volunteer civic hacking.</li>
  <li>We recorded <strong><a href="#videos">58 video presentations</a></strong> and launched our own YouTube channel.</li>
  <li>We heard <strong><a href="#lightning-talks">26 lightning talks</a></strong> from members of our community shared their own story or insight about civics, society and technology.</li>
  <li>We started <strong><a href="#breakouts">68 breakout groups</a></strong> for participants to build, share and learn about civic tech.</li>
  <li>We <strong><a href="#budget">spent $44,673.57</a></strong> on food, video production and miscellaneous expenses to run our events for 2016.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="presentations">33 presentations</h2>

    <em>Presentations at Chi Hack Night in 2016</em>

</p>

<p>This year, we had 33 presentations ranging from government innovators like Chicago Chief Data Officer Tom Schenk, Code for America founder Jennifer Pahlka, to independent journalists like Brandon Smith, to activists like the Chicago Community Bond Fund, to members of our own community who use data and technology to make positive change in our society.</p>

</p>

<p>April 12th, 2016 marked our <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/04/15/tales-from-200.html">200th Chi Hack Night</a>! To celebrate, we held our first ever Lightning talks session with presentations from 9 members of Chi Hack Night about what they’ve done at or learned from our group.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/03/25/chi-hack-night-200-call-for-speakers-and-writers.html">invited folks</a> to share their Chi Hack Night stories, projects, learnings and congratulations in written form and got 5 submissions.</p>

<p>We also commissioned 200 Chi Hack Night star cookies - each one numbered 1-200 for every event we’ve had. Here’s how they turned out:</p>

<h2 id="pledges">2 open data pledges</h2>

<p>2016 being an election this year, we saw an opportunity to advocate for open data in more offices of our local government.</p>

<p>With competitive races for Cook County State’s Attorney and Clerk of the Circuit court, we reached out to all candidates with a <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/02/12/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-states-attorney.html">pledge</a> to, if elected, commit their office to publish open data. We were successful in getting 3 signatures: <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/02/12/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-states-attorney.html">Donna More and Kim Foxx for State’s Attorney</a>, and <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/02/16/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-clerk-of-the-circuit-court.html">Jacob Meister for Clerk of the Circuit Court</a>.</p>

<p>This was a huge success for us, as <strong>Kim Foxx, who signed our pledge</strong>, won the election for State’s Attorney, and looks to be following through on her promise in her <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-kimm-foxx-interview-met-20161205-story.html">plans to create a new position of Chief Data Officer</a> for her office. We’ll be watching closely how it takes shape in 2017!</p>

<h2 id="projects">3 civic apps that influenced government policy</h2>

<p>This was a banner year for high impact civic technology in Chicago. Three projects from our community had a direct influence over government policy in Chicago in 2016. We influenced new ordinances, worked with environmental advocacy groups and partnered directly with the City.</p>

<p><a href="http://mybuildingdoesntrecycle.com/">My Building Doesn’t Recycle</a> is a app that allows Chicago residents of high-density (5 or more residential units) apartment buildings to report that their building management is not providing recycling services. The goal of the app was to get the city to strengthen and enforce the existing recycling law, which it succeeded in doing.</p>

<p>After being<a href="http://mybuildingdoesntrecycle.com/press"> picked up by the press</a> and getting the attention of the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation, My Building Doesn’t Recycle<a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/07/15/recycling-reform-is-on-the-horizon-in-chicago.html"> influenced the drafting</a> of a stronger recycling ordinance, which was<a href="https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20160720/downtown/recycling-fines-going-up-for-arpartment-buildiings-that-dont-recycle"> passed by Chicago City Council</a> and will go into effect January 2017.</p>

<p>Claire Micklin, the project lead, presented at Chi Hack Night after the ordinance was passed. Watch her talk,<a href="https://chihacknight.org/events/2016/09/27/my-building-doesnt-recycle.html"> My Building Doesn’t Recycle: Designing for Policy Change</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://petcokealerts.org/">Petcokealerts.org</a> is a text message alert system to inform residents around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCBX_Terminals">KCBX Terminals</a> in Chicago’s 10th Ward that windspeed is high, and that they are therefore at increased risk of exposure to petroleum coke (‘petcoke’).</p>

<p>After launching,<a href="http://petcokealerts.org/"> Petcokealerts.org</a> became a rallying point for<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Chicago-South-East-Side-Coalition-To-Ban-Petcoke-848330295223606/"> the Southeast Side Coalition to Ban Petcoke</a>, who used it as one of many tools to organize for the removal of the petcoke piles.</p>

<p>June 9, 2016, Chicago City Council<a href="https://chicago.councilmatic.org/legislation/o-2014-9766/"> passed an ordinance</a> mandating that the piles be removed or enclosed and although KCBX tried hard to fight it, in the end<a href="http://progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2016/06/09/chicagos-southeast-siders-secure-petcoke-victory-detail-next-steps"> they complied</a>. By the time the piles were removed, Petcokealerts.org had nearly 400 subscribers, and had alerted them to high winds on 96 days.</p>

<p>Chicago has three-dozen beaches that, sometimes, have high E. Coli levels. When do we need to warn the 9 million annual visitors of potentially high E. Coli levels? In 2016, members of Chi Hack Night built an improved statistical model to predict the E. coli levels at Chicago’s beaches.</p>

<p>Built entirely by a team of volunteers from Chicago’s civic tech community, this predictive model was<a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/06/23/taking-predictive-analytics-to-the-beach.html"> officially adopted by the City of Chicago in May 2016</a> to help the<a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/"> Park District</a> know when they should issue warnings to swimmers of potentially high levels of bacteria.</p>

<p>With the help of our sponsors, we hired <a href="http://scrappersfilmgroup.com/">Scrappers Film Group</a> to record and edit high quality videos for our presentations and lightning talks. Our goal in this is to both share and archive the talks and work done at Chi Hack Night for ourselves and others around the world.</p>

<p>We recorded and posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dBjjdnIbKyq4RTcsRWrwyAyPhx71trz">31 presentations</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dBjjdnIbKwCnqq3FXuAcMYcIc5Sr8Q-">26 lightning talks</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3Ltxgiw46o">one promotional video</a> to our new YouTube channel. Since launching, we have logged over 7,700 views and 38,000 minutes of watch time. That’s a lot of civic tech!</p>

<h2 id="lightning-talks">26 lightning talks</h2>

</small>
</p>

<p>This year, we introduced a new presentation format: Lightning talks. This proved to be a really great way to hear from a variety of perspectives from our community in a short amount of time (each presenter got 2 minutes, though this was not strictly enforced).</p>

<p>It worked out so well, in fact, that we did it three times for a total of 26 talks. You can watch each batch here, or view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dBjjdnIbKwCnqq3FXuAcMYcIc5Sr8Q-">all 26 on our YouTube playlist</a>.</p>

<h2 id="breakouts">68 breakout groups using GitHub issues</h2>

<p>Breakout groups are how we organize the civic hacking part of our events. The organization and management of these groups has evolved over time, but the premise has remained the same: anyone is free to start a breakout group and every group is self-organized.</p>

<p>To streamline the creation and expiration of these groups, Chi Hack Night member Ethan Hepner led a series of experiments using <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">GitHub issues</a> to keep track of them.</p>

<p>By making it easy to open up a group as a new ‘issue’ or flag it as ‘closed’ when it ends, the number of listed breakout groups has exploded: 68 new groups have been created since we started using it.</p>

<p>This also had the additional benefit of acting as a ‘gateway drug’ for non-developers to start using GitHub, as it is already used heavily by programmers and project managers at Chi Hack Night.</p>

<p>Now, with the help of the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a>, the Chi Hack Night breakout groups page is powered completely by GitHub issues. <a href="https://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html">Check it out</a>!</p>

<h2 id="budget">We spent $44,673.57 on civic tech in 2016</h2>

<p>As open gov and transparency advocates, it’s important that we hold ourselves to the same standards we expect of our government institutions. It is with that in mind that we have decided to publish our full budget for 2016, including itemized sponsor income and event expenses.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RM52e--xtg1hDrGYzSc9XGeYM-CbkIVjMgHPaeqsDxA/edit#gid=811878668">final budget numbers for Chi Hack Night 2016</a> are in:</p>

<p><strong>Income</strong></p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <td>Sponsor income</td>
    <td>$48,486.49</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Merch income</td>
    <td>$560.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Total income</strong></td>
    <td><strong>$49,046.49</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Expenses</strong></p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <td>Food expense</td>
    <td>$24,306.94</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Video expense</td>
    <td>$19,240.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>General expense</td>
    <td>$1,126.63</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Total expenses</strong></td>
    <td><strong>$44,673.57</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We ended with a net difference of <strong>$4,372.92</strong>, which we will apply towards our events in 2017.</p>

<h2 id="heres-to-2017">Here’s to 2017!</h2>

<p>We have some great things planned for 2017, many of them driven by feedback we’ve gotten directly from our community.</p>

<p>To all of our sponsors: Braintree, Microsoft, DataMade, Dev Bootcamp, Google, UChicago CAPP, Twilio, Metis, Carto and Mozilla Hive Chicago, thank you for supporting us.</p>

<p><strong>To everyone, thank you for being a part of our community.</strong></p>

<p>See you at our next Chi Hack Night: Tuesday, January 3rd, 2017!</p>
