</p>

<p>2018 is here! And it’s time to look back on all that we did at Chi Hack Night in 2017.</p>

<p>In the last year, Chi Hack Night focused more than ever on hearing from and engaging with a diverse range of Chicagoans through our presentations, breakout group projects and leadership team.</p>

<p>In many ways, it feels like Chi Hack Night really came into its own in the last year, from becoming a campaign stop for candidates for Governor, to exerting our influence to promote open data policies, to being officially recognized and honored by Chicago City Council and the Cook County Board, to launching a new series of community hack nights.</p>

<p>For those newer to Chi Hack Night, this is the fourth year in review that we have done. Take a look at our year-in-review posts from <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/12/31/2016-year-in-review.html">2016</a>, <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/12/22/chi-hack-night-2015-year-in-review.html">2015</a> and <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2015/01/06/open-gov-hack-night-2014-year-in-review.html">2014</a> to follow along how we got here.</p>

<p>Now, let’s start with some high-level stats about Chi Hack Night in 2017:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We hosted <strong>48 events</strong>, selling out 29 of them. If it’s Tuesday, it’s hack night, and it’s the place to be.</li>
  <li>We had <strong><a href="#presentations">35 presentations</a></strong> hearing from 3 candidates for Illinois governor, 5 elected officials, 15 local government agencies, 25 nonprofits, businesses and universities, and members from our own community.</li>
  <li>We partnered with the Smart Chicago Collaborative to host a month-long <strong><a href="#women-in-tech">Women in Tech Speaker Series</a></strong> and held our first ever satellite hack nights in Homan Square and Washington Park.</li>
  <li>We also started our first official <strong><a href="#logan">satellite hack night series in Logan Square</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>We held our <strong><a href="#5-years">5 year celebration</a></strong> and received honorific resolutions recognizing our community from the Cook County Board of Commissioners and Chicago City Council.</li>
  <li>We circulated and collected 4 signatures for our <strong><a href="#pledge">open data pledge for Illinois Governor</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>We radically <strong><a href="#leadership">expanded and diversified our event leadership</a></strong>, including a new co-organizer, 15 new co-hosts, booking and web teams.</li>
  <li>We started and continued <strong><a href="#breakouts">72 breakout groups</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>We <strong><a href="#budget">spent $56,344.24</a></strong> on food, video production and miscellaneous expenses to run our events for 2017.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="presentations">We heard 35 presentations</h2>

    <em>Screenshots from 35 Chi Hack Night presentations in 2017</em>
</small>
</p>

<p>This year, we heard from 3 candidates for Illinois governor, 6 elected officials, 15 local government agencies, 25 nonprofits, businesses and universities, members from our own community and more.</p>

<p>Our events were the best attended they’ve ever been. 29 of our 48 events were sold out (each event has 120 tickets).</p>

<p>In addition to landing some of the most high profile speakers we’ve ever had, including Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, JB Pritzker, Robin Robinson, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart and Ald Ameya Pawar, we also had the most diverse collection of speakers in any year of Chi Hack Night. Of the 72 presenters, 31 of them were women and 26 of them were persons of color. This is a trend we plan on continuing for years to come.</p>

<p>The topics and presenters spanned a broad range of issues related to civic tech including government technology (gov tech), issue advocacy, health, environment, design, education, data journalism, candidates for governor and elected officials.</p>

<p>Below is every presentation from 2017, organized by topic. You can also watch all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dBjjdnIbKyt2Yymlfg6awbSksCxy8w1&amp;disable_polymer=true">35 of them in one YouTube playlist</a>.</p>

<p>In March, Smart Chicago Collaborative and Chi Hack Night teamed up to create a speaking series in celebration of Women’s History Month in an effort to elevate the talented, diverse women in civic-driven technology across Chicago.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/03/07/presenting-the-women-in-tech-speaker-series.html">Women in Tech Speakers Series</a> consisted of four Chi Hack Night events with presentations from:</p>

<p>We also hosted our first ever community-focused satellite events: <a href="https://chihacknight.org/satellite/2017/03/30/amplifiers-of-community-voice.html">Amplifiers of Community Voice in at the DuSable Museum in Washington Park</a> and <a href="https://chihacknight.org/satellite/2017/03/29/creators-and-founders.html">Creators &amp; Founders at the Homan Square Community Center</a>.</p>

<p>In response to <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/11/26/post-election-community-feedback-results.html">community feedback</a> we got in November of 2016, Eric Sherman and Andra Stanciu launched our first ever community-focused satellite hack night event at <a href="https://www.secondshiftchicago.com/">Second Shift </a>in Logan Square.  With two events under their belt, they are well on their way to bringing the Chi Hack Night event format and ethos into the communities that make Chicago great.</p>

<p>April 18th, 2017 marked Chi Hack Night’s <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/04/24/5-years-celebration-recap.html">250th event and </a><a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/04/24/5-years-celebration-recap.html">five-year anniversary</a>. For this special hack night, we asked for presentations along the theme of 5 years forward / 5 years back. We also opened up the format a bit and encourage other kinds of performances, and got a poem, a skit and an honorific resolution! You can watch all 7 lightning performances all on our<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dBjjdnIbKyUMPMCA_ok6A8rYGxSu0Qc"> YouTube playlist</a>.</p>

<p>Cook County Commissioner John Fritchey presented an honorific resolution commemorating the event. You can download a copy of<a href="https://chihacknight.org/docs/Board of Commissioners of Cook County - 17-2735.pdf"> resolution 17-2735 here</a>.</p>

<p>Alderman Ameya Pawar also introduced a similar honorific resolution to Chicago City Council: <a href="https://chicago.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3026583&amp;GUID=81A8CD54-3C2F-4F23-B996-DC7BB810C1E3&amp;Options=Advanced&amp;Search=">R2017-336</a>.</p>

<p>We invited our members, alumni and past presenters to share how Chi Hack Night and its community has affected or benefited them. <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/04/18/reflecting-on-5-years-of-chi-hack-night.html">We were floored by your responses</a>. It turns out you like us — you really like us!</p>

<h2 id="pledge">The Chi Hack Night Open Data Pledge for Illinois Governor</h2>

<p>With the initial success of our open data pledges for<a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/02/12/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-states-attorney.html"> Cook County State’s Attorney</a> and<a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/02/16/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-clerk-of-the-circuit-court.html"> Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court</a> in 2016, Chi Hack Night turned our attention in 2017 to Illinois’ most important statewide race: Governor.</p>

<p>Chi Hack Night, representing Chicago’s civic technology community, invited every candidate for Governor of Illinois to sign a pledge to, if elected, commit their office to an open data policy and practice. You can read the whole <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/10/03/open-data-pledge-for-illinois-governor.html">9-point open data pledge here</a>.</p>

<p>To date, we have collected 4 signatures: Ameya Pawar (D), Daniel Biss (D), Chris Kennedy (D), J.B. Pritzker (D). Senator Biss even issued a <a href="https://www.danielbiss.com/open-data-policy/">signing statement</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll continue to follow up with the candidates as the race progresses. If one of the signers becomes our next Governor, we’ll be holding them to account on the pledge they signed.</p>

<h2 id="leadership">Expanded and diversified our event leadership</h2>

<p>2017 saw a significant expansion of the people involved in running Chi Hack Night.</p>

<p>Christopher and I have been operating and hosting Chi Hack Night with the help of other volunteers in the Leadership Council, for over 4 years. But with my second kid (born in June of 2017) and Christopher’s extensive travel schedule, our involvement became limited.</p>

<p>Our limited availability and bandwidth, however, led to new opportunities for others to step in and take a greater leadership role, and many did.</p>

<p>In January, we started rotating in new event co-hosts. In April, we set up dedicated website management and presentation booking teams. And in September we added a third lead organizer at the top: Emily Drevets.</p>

</p>

<p>We set out to not just increase the number of people participating, but the diversity of those involved as well.</p>

<p>In January, we set a goal to achieve gender parity for our co-hosts. <strong>I am happy to announce that we were successful in this</strong>! For all 48 of our events, we had as many female as we had male co-hosts. This is something we plan to continue and expand into other measures of diversity in 2018.</p>

<p>Here’s a shout-out to everyone who co-hosted Chi Hack Night in 2017!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emily Drevets</li>

</p>

<p>Breakout groups are how we organize the civic hacking part of our events. The organization and management of these groups has evolved over time, but the premise has remained the same: anyone is free to start a breakout group and every group is self-organized.</p>

<p>Here’s a shout out to some of our longstanding breakout groups! Keep up the awesome work!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to Justice</li>
  <li>Quantifying Justice News</li>
  <li>Deportation/Immigration/Refugee Task Force</li>
  <li>Fantasy Civics</li>
  <li>Illinois Legislative Working Group / Witness Slips</li>
  <li>Chicago Deaf and DeafBlind in Tech</li>
  <li>Hack Night Labs</li>
  <li>Caravan</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="budget">We spent $56,344.24 on civic tech in 2017</h2>

<p>As open gov and transparency advocates, it’s important that we hold ourselves to the same standards we expect of our government institutions. It is with that in mind that we have continue to to publish our full budget including itemized sponsor income and event expenses.</p>

<p>Here’s our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSRbsPluteMrnJr-3XTVDGa7nBEsKtRksONPj2Fr1nE/edit#gid=811878668">2017 budget</a> and our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RM52e--xtg1hDrGYzSc9XGeYM-CbkIVjMgHPaeqsDxA/edit#gid=811878668">2016 budget</a> for reference.</p>

<p>The final budget numbers for Chi Hack Night 2017 are in:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <tr>
    <td>Total sponsor income</td>
    <td>+$61,050.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Food expenses</td>
    <td>-$28,692.61</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Video production expenses</td>
    <td>-$19,510.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ASL interpreter expenses</td>
    <td>-$6,750.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>General operating expenses</td>
    <td>-$1,391.63</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total expenses</td>
    <td><strong>$56,344.24</strong></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We ended with a net difference of <strong>$4,705.76</strong>, which we will apply towards our events in 2017.</p>

<h2 id="2018">Here’s to 2018!</h2>

<p class="text-center"><img src="/images/blog/2017-12-28-2017-year-in-review/chn-crowd.jpg" alt="Chi Hack Night will return in 2018!" class="img-thumbnail" /><br />

    <em>Chi Hack Night will return in 2018!</em>
</small>
</p>

<p>Since starting Chi Hack Night in 2012, we’ve learned that <a href="https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/03/10/technology-alone-cant-solve-chicagos-murder-problem.html">technology alone can’t solve Chicago’s, or the world’s, problems</a>. With the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-other-tech-bubble/">growing disillusionment</a> with the Silicon Valley tech sector, it’s clear we need to find a way to balance the awesome power of technology with society’s best interests.</p>

<p>Who is in the room when decisions are made and who is at the table when projects are built matters. A tech sector that is dominated by straight white men does not serve all of society equally.</p>

<p>That is why it has become Chi Hack Night’s goal to have our community reflect the diverse population of Chicago. And we won’t stop until we get there.</p>

<p>We have some great things planned for 2018, many of them driven by feedback we’ve gotten directly from our community.</p>

<p>To all of our sponsors: Braintree, Microsoft, Google, DataMade, Dev Bootcamp, Twilio, Metis, City Base, Open Tech Strategies, Civis Analytics, mRelief, Chicago Cityscape and eSpark Learning thank you for supporting us.</p>

<p><strong>To everyone, thank you for being a part of our community.</strong></p>

<p>See you at our next Chi Hack Night: Tuesday, January 9th, 2018 with Chris Kennedy, Candidate for Illinois Governor!</p>
