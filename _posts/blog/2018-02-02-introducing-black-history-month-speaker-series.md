Last March, hundreds of technologists, civic leaders, and community members heard from talented, diverse women who work in civic-driven technology across Chicago. As a collaboration between Smart Chicago Collaborative and [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/), the [Women in Tech speaker series](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/women-in-tech-speakers-series/) was created to address the lack of diversity we see in the civic tech community and elevate the personal narratives of women driving impactful efforts throughout our city. 

Our six events highlighted incredible speakers from different sectors who shared the experiences that inspire their work. Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, for example, [spoke about her career as a teacher and being a woman in public office](https://chihacknight.org/events/2017/03/07/toni-preckwinkle.html). Melissa Pierce, an independent film director*,* shared her inspiration to [document Grace Hopper’s extraordinary story](http://gracehopperfilm.com/) as one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer.  Sandee Kastrul, president and co-founder of [i.c.stars](http://www.icstars.org/), [shared her experiences](https://chihacknight.org/events/2017/03/14/sandee-kastrul.html) founding this innovative technology training program in 1999 to prepare inner-city adults for technology careers and community leadership.

We also hosted Chi Hack Night’s [first community satellite events](https://chihacknight.org/events/index.html#/?search=women in civic tech) that highlighted entrepreneurs and women utilizing technology to amplify civic engagement. These community events became a growing priority to diversify our thriving technology community and develop opportunities to bring new programs into the community.

Since last March, great things happened for each organization– Smart Chicago merged with City Digital to [become City Tech Collaborative](http://www.uilabs.org/press/city-digital-and-smart-chicago-collaborative-join-forces-with-support-from-macarthur-foundation/) and Chi Hack Night expanded to [host regular community-based events in Logan Square](https://chihacknight.org/events/index.html#/?search=logan square)– but we still acknowledge the need to further highlight diverse individuals in the civic and technology sectors. 

This year, we are expanding our series to celebrate Black History Month in February and Women’s History Month in March.

Our speaker series will coincide with the eight weekly Chi Hack Night events that occur on Tuesdays at Braintree in Merchandise Mart for the months of February and March. Additionally, two community events will be held the last week of February and March in satellite community locations. We hope you will join us!
