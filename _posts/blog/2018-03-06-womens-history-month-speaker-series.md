The month of February was an inspiring showcase of incredible black individuals who activate technology and data to increase digital access and tech opportunities, reform the criminal justice system, found businesses, or build social justice movements. City Tech and Chi Hack Night are grateful to [Kim Foxx](https://chihacknight.org/events/2018/02/13/kim-foxx.html), [Charlene Carruthers](https://chihacknight.org/events/2018/02/27/charlene-carruthers.html), [Fabian Elliott](https://chihacknight.org/events/2018/02/20/fabian-elliott.html), [Alvyn Walker](https://chihacknight.org/events/2018/02/06/alvyn-walker.html) and [Colony 5](https://chihacknight.org/satellite/2018/02/28/entrepreneurial-journeys-black-women-activating-tech.html) for sharing their stories and challenging us to reflect on the inequities that exist in our communities.

</p>

This month, City Tech and Chi Hack Night will build on this momentum and highlight women who work in the civic and technology sectors as part of Women’s History Month. Our goal for this speaker series is to continue to address the lack of diversity we see in the civic tech community and elevate the experiences and stories of women who are leading impactful work.

Our speaker series will coincide with the four weekly Chi Hack Night events that occur on Tuesdays at Braintree in Merchandise Mart for the months of March. Additionally, one community event will be held in a satellite community location. We hope you will join us!
