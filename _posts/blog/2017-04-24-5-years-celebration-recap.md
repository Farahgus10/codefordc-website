April 18, 2017 was our 250th episode of Chi Hack Night and 5 year anniversary.

For this special hack night, we asked for presentations along the theme of **5 years forward / 5 years back**. We also wanted to open up the format a bit and encourage other kinds of performances, including talks, poems, songs and skits.

Here are the 7 lightning performances. You can also watch them all on our [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_dBjjdnIbKyUMPMCA_ok6A8rYGxSu0Qc).
