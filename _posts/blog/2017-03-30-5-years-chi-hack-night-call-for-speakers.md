**April 18, 2017 will mark the 250th episode of Chi Hack Night. That's 5 years!**

To celebrate this day, we want to hear from you, the members of Chi Hack Night. 

As we did [last year](/blog/2016/04/15/tales-from-200.html), you can participate in two ways:

### <i class='fa fa-bolt'></i> Lightning presentations: 5 years forward / 5 years back

For this special hack night, we're looking for presentations along the theme of **5 years forward / 5 years back**. What will civic tech look like in 5 years? What were you doing 5 years ago that might have been considered civic tech before it was even a thing?

Tom Schenk, Chicago's Chief Data Officer, gave a talk in this vein last year:

<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7zxzHw3gsj4" width="100%"></iframe></p>

These will be lightning **performances**. We encourage you to do any kind of performance that you'd like. It could be a talk, a poem, a song, a skit, or something else. Get creative!

Guidelines:

- Must be themed around 5 years forward / 5 years back in civic tech
- May be a talk, a poem, a song, a skit, or *something else*
- 5 minutes or less in length
- Must not solicit any company or commercial product

Between five and ten proposed presentations will be picked to present at Chi Hack Night #250 for fame and glory!

[Submit your lightning presentation here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc3tYmb_dPU-c2FrshJUZCdYyMuLtI90evdOoZMG8rkilZvtQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) by Thursday, April 13th.

### <i class='fa fa-pencil'></i> Testimonials

We're also collecting testimonials from Chi Hack Night members, speakers and alumni.

Has Chi Hack Night affected you in some way? Did you work on a meaningful project? Make a new friend? Land a job? We want to hear from you! We'll gather these testimonials and share them on our [blog](http://chihacknight.org/blog/).
