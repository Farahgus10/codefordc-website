</p>

Chi Hack Night is inviting every candidate for Cook County State’s Attorney to sign a pledge to, if elected, commit their office to publish open data. 

### Update 3: As State's Attorney, Kim Foxx Establishes Open Data Program

Cook County State’s Attorney Foxx has built a data program within her office, including hiring a Chief Data Officer and releasing a first-ever [data report](https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/sites/default/files/files/documents/ccsao-data-report-oct-2017.pdf). On March 2, 2018, their office [released over six years of felony criminal case data on the Cook County Open Data Portal](https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/news/states-attorney-foxx-announces-unprecedented-open-data-release).

You can watch [State's Attorney Foxx and her Chief Data Officer Matt Saniie present](https://chihacknight.org/events/2018/02/13/kim-foxx.html) their work and preview the first ever open data released from their office. During their presentation, we got to ask if this Open Data Pledge had any influence on their decision to pursue their open data program. [Here is her full response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=34m20s&v=tBEjk3AA608).

> It helped make the case. Because again, there was not any model that we were able to follow. Because there was an appetite - because there was a pledge - we had to be committed to this.
