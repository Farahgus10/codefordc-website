### Why an Open Data Pledge?
Representative democracies thrive on transparency and accountability, facilitated by open access to information. The State of Illinois collects and stores a wide range of data that’s critical for the public to know and use. 

As the chief executive for the state, we ask our candidates for Governor commit to supporting open data practices to benefit all constituents, including citizens, organizations, journalists, and other government entities. With the initial success of our open data pledges for [Cook County State’s Attorney](/blog/2016/02/12/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-states-attorney.html) and [Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court](/blog/2016/02/16/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-clerk-of-the-circuit-court.html), Chi Hack Night is turning our attention to Illinois’ most important statewide race.
