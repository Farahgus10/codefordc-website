### Why an Open Data Pledge?
Criminal, economic, and social justice require transparency and accountability, facilitated by open access to information. The Attorney General’s office collects and stores a wide range of data on our legal system that’s critical for the public to know and use. 

Given the success of our open data pledges from [Cook County State’s Attorney](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/02/12/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-states-attorney.html), [Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2016/02/16/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-clerk-of-the-circuit-court.html), and [Illinois Governo](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2017/10/03/open-data-pledge-for-illinois-governor.html)r candidates, Chi Hack Night now turns its attention to the highest law enforcement office in Illinois. 

We ask that our Attorney General candidates commit to open data practices for the benefit of all constituents, including citizens, organizations, journalists, and other government entities.
