In November 2015, [Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar) held its first [national openly-contested election in 25 years](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-33547036). A [partnership with the Asia Foundation and the local election commission](http://asiafoundation.org/2015/09/11/myanmar-technology-community-launch-maepaysoh-lets-vote-hack-challenge/) allowed records on thousands of candidates to be digitized and published in the open for the first time, establishing a precedent for future open elections.

[Nick Doiron](https://twitter.com/mapmeld), Code for America alum and Traveling Freelance Developer and Mapmaker, will talk about his experience working with this election data at the [MaePaySoh hackathon](http://www.maepaysoh.org/). Heâ€™ll also go over a few other projects he worked on while in Southeast Asia, including an open disaster notification system for Thailand and standardizing Burmese/Myanmar language support for computers.
