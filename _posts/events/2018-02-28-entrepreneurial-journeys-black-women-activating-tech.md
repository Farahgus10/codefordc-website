**Panel discussion**

In 2017, Nielsen reported that black women are not only leading influencers in the economy, media, and politics, but they are the fastest growing group of female entrepreneurs. Colony 5, a business accelerator connecting social entrepreneurs, furthered the possibility of entrepreneurship when selecting 4 of the most recent members of the 2018 (C518) cohort Ehi Aimuiwu, founder of Geek Empowered and Civic Tech Collective founder, Monique Wingard, will close out Black History Month and transition into Womenâ€™s History Month with a panel at Chi Hack Night on February 28, 2018, called Entrepreneurial Journeys: Black Women Activating Tech. 

The final Chi Hack Night of February 2018 will focus on the personal journey and ultimate leap of faith taken to join the ranks of other female founders in tech, as well as the connection points for growth in the ever-changing Chicago tech ecosystem and beyond.
