Formed in 2014 as the first Latino tech network in Chicago, [Latin@ Techies](https://www.meetup.com/Latino-Techies/) creates community-based events to expose young Latin@s to STEM, connect tech professionals, and, through their [annual Latin@ Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/1700846456904525/), leverage tech to tackle critical community issues.  

This past November, the all-day hackathon gathered 30 housing advocates, artists, developers, journalists, and community members to create community-driven tech solutions on fair housing and community development. Teams worked towards diverse solutions, from making zoning meetings transparent to empowering tenants through storytelling to making open data accessible to housing advocates.

Latin@ Hackathon organizers Luz Chavez and Kara Carrell will give an overview of the event. Noah Moskowitz, Antonio Gutierrez, Henri Idrovo, Shelley Hoover and Janet Gomez, all members of the winning team, will show off their project and how they tackled the question “How can we leverage technology to build renter power?"

**ASL** This event will have an American Sign Language interpreter.
