This week, we welcome [Sana Jafri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sana-jafri-2ab90319), program officer for the [Chicago Learning Exchange (CLX)](https://hivechicago.org/same-hive-new-steward/). She will present on how CLX facilitates the connection and exchange of different nodes: educators, programs, technology, and learners.

Sana’s work revolves around how technology can be leveraged for learning and how technology concepts like networks and working in the open can be applied to the education world. Similar to the Chi Hack Night community, Sana works closely with the Hive Chicago Learning Network, which brings educators together monthly to think about how to leverage technology for learning.
