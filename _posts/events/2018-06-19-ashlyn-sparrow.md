Coming out of [University of Chicago’s Center for Interdisciplinary Inquiry and Innovation in Sexual and Reproductive Health](https://www.uchicago.edu/research/center/center_for_interdisciplinary_inquiry_and_innovation_in_sexual_and_reproduct/) (Ci3) [Game Changer Chicago Design Lab](https://ci3.uchicago.edu/labs/game-changer-chicago/) (GCC), Bystander is a game-based sexual violence prevention program that is comprised of a video game and a curriculum for youth aged 14-18 years.
