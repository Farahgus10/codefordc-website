There will be no presentation this week. Instead, we're going to have another civic hacking potluck! If you'd like to bring drinks, snacks or desserts, [fill out your name and what you're bringing here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tZOLTZDar7wKlkUrvNF9-_EDT65G2ezaCaTjbX-aWSU/edit#gid=0)! We'll provide the usual empanadas too.

While we eat, we'll build, share, and learn about civic tech!
