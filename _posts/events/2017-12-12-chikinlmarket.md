On December 12th, Chi Hack Night will be magically transformed through the power of the civic tech holiday spirit into . . . . **Chikindlmarket**! 

Visitors from all around Chicagoland (and beyond!) can play games, gnosh on sausages, pretzels, and other holiday treats, do [screen printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_printing), and thank each other for the accomplishments of the past year. Come and get to know some new folks â€” it might be cold outside, but it's cozy at Chikindlmarket!

You should: 

 * Come wearing your tackiest (or most beautiful) holiday sweater!
 * Bring cookie, sweets, holiday drinks or something else lovely to share 
 * Bring an item of clothing for screen printing to make your very own customized Chi Hack Night swag! (100% cotton and darker colors for the best results)

See you Tuesday!
