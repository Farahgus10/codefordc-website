[Read more about the series here](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2018/02/02/introducing-black-history-month-speaker-series.html).*

[Black Tech Mecca](https://www.blacktechmecca.org/) is a data driven think tank dedicated to building thriving Black Tech Ecosystems through research, education and advocacy. 

[Fabian Elliott](https://twitter.com/Fabian_Elliott), CEO of Black Tech Mecca, will discuss Black Tech Mecca’s groundbreaking research report, [Unleashing Chicago’s Black Tech Ecosystem: Assessing, Defining, and Growing Chicago’s BTE](https://www.blacktechmecca.org/research/).
 
The report evaluates the engagement of local Black communities with the tech sector along three main pillars: academic, corporate, and entrepreneurship. The study includes recommendations for strengthening local data pipelines, removing barriers, and increasing opportunities for Black participation in the local tech sector, thus increasing the region’s overall potential for economic growth.
