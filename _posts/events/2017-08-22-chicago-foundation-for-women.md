We know facts and figures around gender inequality in America. Women earn 79 cents on the dollar. 6 percent of Fortune 500 companies have a woman CEO. One in three women experience violence in her lifetime.

How do we move Chicago closer to gender parity, and how can data help us get there? [Chicago Foundation for Women](https://www.cfw.org/) invests in women and girls as catalysts, building strong communities for all. As a community-based funder investing in work that supports equal opportunities and basic rights for women and girls, they launched [The 100% Project](https://www.cfw.org/100-percent/) in 2015, an ambitious goal to end gender bias and get to gender equity by 2030.

Chicago Foundation for Women President and CEO [K. Sujata](https://twitter.com/k_sujata) will share their vision for gender equity, and how the foundation is using data to remove barriers for women and girls.
