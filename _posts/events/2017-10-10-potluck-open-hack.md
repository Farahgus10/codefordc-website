There will be no presentation this week. Instead, we're going to have another civic hacking potluck! Please bring drinks, snacks or desserts if you can! We'll provide the usual empanadas too.

While we eat, we'll build, share, and learn about civic tech!

**ASL** This event will have an American Sign Language interpreter.

**Food** Food and drinks will be provided. We encourage attendees to bring their own water bottles to reduce waste.
