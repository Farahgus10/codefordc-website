This week, we welcome [Susana Mendoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susana_Mendoza), Comptroller for the State of Illinois. After serving as an Illinois State Representative and as Chicago’s City Clerk, she was elected into the [office of Comptroller](http://illinoiscomptroller.gov/) in December of last year. The Comptroller is responsible for maintaining the State of Illinois’ fiscal accounts, and for ordering payments into and out of them, a daunting task for a State with over [$14 billion in overdue bills](https://illinoiscomptroller.gov/news-portal/illinois-backlog-of-unpaid-bills-jumps-to-14-3-billion/).

In her talk, Comptroller Mendoza will provide an overview of the technological challenges facing her office and the State of Illinois, and the ways she intends to address them. She’ll also discuss her effort to increase transparency and accountability through legislation in the [Debt Transparency Act](https://illinoiscomptroller.gov/news-portal/debt-transparency-act-which-would-reveal-the-real-cost-of-the-bill-backlog-passes-in-the-house-with-bipartisan-backing/).
