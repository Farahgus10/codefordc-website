This week, we'll be hearing from two of our very own hack night-ers!

In Chicago, sidewalks are essential in connecting us to just about any activity outside our own homes. Dilapidated and inaccessible sidewalks make getting around more difficult, if not impossible.

[Steven Luker](https://twitter.com/1armedgeek), a web developer, and [Adam Hecktman](https://twitter.com/AdamHecktman), Civic technologist for Microsoft, will discuss various ways that bad sidewalks not only make things difficult and dangerous for Chicagoans, and how a new civic app, [Chi Safe Path](http://www.chisafepath.com/), provides a way to deal with them.
