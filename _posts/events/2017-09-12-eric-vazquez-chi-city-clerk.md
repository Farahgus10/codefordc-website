How does one account for the various needs of every single Chicagoan? Or provide the most value in the delivery of city services? What does it take to confront the challenges of rolling controversial or complex initiatives?  

Eric Vazquez, Chief Technology Officer for the [Chicago City Clerk](http://www.chicityclerk.com/), wrestles with these questions on a daily basis and will share how he is introducing Human Centered Design into the City’s most visited government Office.

Eric Vazquez is a native Chicagoan. He studied English at the University of Illinois and proceeded to work in the fast-paced, bubble-bursting Web 1.0 scene. Grateful for an opportunity to serve the people of Chicago, Eric is responsible for bringing together technology across departments, identifying and exploiting new technologies and driving overall Office technology strategy.
