The [HealthCare.gov launch debacle](https://www.propublica.org/article/heres-why-healthcaregov-broke-down) has led to vigorous effort on several fronts to course-correct the way the government creates software. The new agencies [USDS](https://www.usds.gov/) and [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) are premised on the notion of rebalancing the public sector with private sector talent from within. At the same time, a new breed of technology vendors, drawing on the same talent pool, is emerging to provide services to government from without.

[Paul Smith](https://pauladamsmith.com/about.html), one of the people who fixed HealthCare.gov and co-founder of government sofware agency [Ad Hoc](http://adhocteam.us/), will touch on what's happened in the nearly 3 years since the president's signature domestic policy was nearly upended by poorly-developed software. From the perspective of a new small company working in this space, there are reasons to be optimistic that change is happening and starting taking root across government.
