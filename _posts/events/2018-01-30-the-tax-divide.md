In 2017, ProPublica Illinois and the Chicago Tribune published [The Tax Divide](https://features.propublica.org/the-tax-divide/cook-county-commercial-and-industrial-property-tax-assessments/), a four-part series examining deep inequities in the Cook County’s property tax assessments system. 

The system, which touches every family in the county, was known to be highly regressive, but reporters found that the assessor’s office ignored the problem and misled the public.

[ProPublica Illinois](https://www.propublica.org/illinois) reporters [Jason Grotto](https://twitter.com/jasongrotto) and [Sandhya Kambhampati](https://twitter.com/sandhya__k) will discuss the stories, [their methodology](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/the-tax-divide-analysis) and the fallout from the series.
