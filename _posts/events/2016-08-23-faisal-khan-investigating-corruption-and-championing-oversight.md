Ensuring that elected and public officials are exercising their power and spending tax dollars properly – and transparently – is many times easier said than done. There are many ways for government officials to hide information from the public, and [Chicago is no exception](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/laquanmcdonald/ct-laquan-mcdonald-email-lisa-madigan-20160816-story.html).
 
[Faisal Khan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faisal-khan-3b074428), former [Legislative Inspector General](https://chicagocode.org/2-55-030/) in Chicago City Hall and current CEO of [Project Six](https://thesecretsix.com/), a nonprofit government investigative taskforce, has learned how to approach investigating government corruption and obtain the information that leads to the truth.
 
Khan will discuss how he works through an investigation into potential government corruption from the early planning stages to final vetting of information and data. What information does one look for and how can investigators uncover the truth?
