Much of what we do at Chi Hack Night can be described as organizing. Though technology and data are the focus, every [breakout group](/breakouts.html) has to identify a problem they want to address, research it, come up with a plan of action, and execute it.

This week, we welcome [Judy Hertz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judy-hertz-56b86526/), Executive Director of [Midwest Academy](http://www.midwestacademy.com/). She will give an introduction a nationally known tool for power analysis and planning community organizing strategy known as the Midwest Academy Strategy Chart.

Judy will look at the key pieces of a public policy campaign, and how they fit together.

 * defining what public policy change you want to win
 * assessing your own organizational power
 * analyzing the power of the decision-maker (the person with the power to say yes to you)
 * principles for building up your coalition
 * what tactics to use to show off your power and get to yes

Then she will discuss with the group the research and data needs of community organizers, and how a group of Internet savvy people can be helpful.
