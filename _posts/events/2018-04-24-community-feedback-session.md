In November, 2016, Chi Hack Night hosted a [community feedback session](/events/2016/11/15/post-election-community-feedback-session.html). We asked how people were feeling about their government and their communities, and what they wanted to learn about. And we talked about how we could channel our energy into positive action. Some <a href="/blog/2016/11/26/post-election-community-feedback-results.html">themes emerged</a>. People wanted to facilitate conversations—preferably getting out of their <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-filter-bubble">filter bubbles</a>—and increase their civic literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy.

Please join us for a facilitated group discussion to reflect on what we’ve done at Chi Hack Night in the last 18 months, share what’s important to us now, and come up with some ideas for taking action.
