Wednesday, December 13th we will convene at Second Shift for the second ever Chi Hack Night in the Logan Square neighborhood!

**Presentation**
[Ali Karbassi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karbassi/) , Founder & CEO of CoderDojoChi, will talk about how his nonprofit is focused on building a better world for our children through the love of coding.

CoderDojoChi is a volunteer not for profit that teaches web, game, and app development to youth ages 7 to 17.

Our mission is to create a fun, collaborative environment to explore STEM. Through challenging play, youth can build memorable experiences with mentors. All classes are 100% free to attend thanks to your generous donations.

Ali Karbassi founded CoderDojoChi in 2013. It has grown to more than 203 active mentors teaching over 894 students. We host twice monthly workshops with dozens of youth, and reach hundreds of families across the Greater Chicago area.

**Civic Tech 101**

Civic Tech 101 will be a short 10 min talk about the basics of civic tech and some examples about how we’ve applied our skills to create impact in our community.

**Manatee Tank**

Do you have an idea or problem you think technology can help solve? Share your idea with us and we’ll help you think through its feasibility, technical and resource requirements and potential for impact.

Manatee Tank is like the show Shark Tank, but instead of scrutinizing and bidding on your business idea, we’ll be nice and give you constructive and helpful feedback on your idea.

**Breakout Groups**

People are invited to break off into groups and work on projects, discuss potential ideas, and share their skills. Members of the Chi Hack Night community will be on site to run several of their breakout groups.

Food will be provided.
