In 2011 the [Chicago Justice Project](https://chicagojustice.org/) created the Justice Media Project to create the architecture to collect and analyze media coverage of crime and violence in Chicago. The goal is to see real time comparisons between the reporting on crime and violence in Chicago and how crime and violence actually occur in Chicago.

The disparity between how crime occurs and how it is reported on in Chicago is vast. This leads to the public taking steps protect themselves from crime and violence that is statistically very unlikely to occur and to push for public policy and criminal justice practices based on unjustified fear of crime rather than evidence based best practices.

In 2016, the initiative was brought to Chi Hack Night as the [Quantifying Justice News breakout group](https://github.com/chihacknight/breakout-groups/issues/61), and they have been working on it ever since. Tracy Siska, Executive Director of the Chicago Justice Project, Kevin Rose, Matt Meshulam, Josh Herzberg and Michael Chladek will present the work they have done to date and how they did it.
