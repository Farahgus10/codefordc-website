[Regional Housing Solutions](https://www.regionalhousingsolutions.org/) is a new tool that helps municipal officials and staff, policy makers, and other housing stakeholders across the Chicago region understand the variation in local housing submarkets, identify where common housing challenges exist across the region, and determine the best strategies to address those challenges.

The [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP)](http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/), [Metropolitan Mayors Caucus (MMC)](http://mayorscaucus.org/), and [Metropolitan Planning Council (MPC)](http://www.metroplanning.org/index.html) created Regional Housing Solutions with technical assistance from the [DePaul Universityâ€™s Institute for Housing Studies (IHS)](https://www.housingstudies.org/), which identified eight distinct subregional housing markets across seven county Chicago region. The project partners then interviewed more than 100 regional of policy makers, for-profit and not-for-profit housing developers, realtors, financial institutions, and municipal staff to develop housing policy solutions tailored to the individual submarkets.

CMAP Associate Planner [Elizabeth Scott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethdscott/) will walk us through the Regional Housing Solutions analysis and website development, highlighting potential uses for the tool.
