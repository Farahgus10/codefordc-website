Between 2012 and 2015, the City of Chicago spent more than $210 million for [police misconduct lawsuits](http://chicagoreporter.com/chicago-does-little-to-control-police-misconduct-or-its-costs/). Bond interest more than doubles the financial cost to taxpayers -- to say nothing of the social and individual costs incurred when police violate citizens' civil rights.

Yet, unlike some other major cities, Chicago doesnâ€™t have a database to analyze police lawsuits for trends, identify the officers most frequently sued, or determine ways to reduce both the cost of the cases and officer misconduct.

Last month, [The Chicago Reporter](http://chicagoreporter.com/about/) built a database of these lawsuits and [published it](http://chicagoreporter.com/settlements). Database reporter [Jonah Newman](https://twitter.com/jonahshai) and data editor [Matt Kiefer](https://twitter.com/matt_kiefer) will explain why the Reporter pursued this project, how the small non-profit was able to piece together thousands of records from various sources, and what the public can learn from the database.
