In October 2017, the Chicago Tribune published [The Water Drain](http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/news/lake-michigan-drinking-water-rates/index.html), a multi-part series investigating water rates throughout the Chicago region.

The Tribune discovered that a profound disparity exists in what people pay for a basic life necessity -- their drinking water -- along income and racial lines. Residents of the poorest communities paid 31 percent more, on average, than those in the wealthiest. At times, collection tactics in poorer communities were akin to those of payday lenders, with water reconnection fees running as high as $300 or more.
