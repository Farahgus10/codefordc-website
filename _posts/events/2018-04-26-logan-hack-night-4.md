Logan Square Hack Night is a monthly civic engagement event to build, share & learn about civic tech in a local neibhorhood instead of downtown!

*Presentation*

Join us as Chicagoan and author Daniel Kay Hertz leads a dialogue around the issues raised in his upcoming book The Battle of Lincoln Park: Urban Renewal and Gentrification in Chicago.

We'll talk about what happened in Lincoln Park during the mid-20th century and also discuss how Chicago’s segregated wealthy neighborhoods were created.

Attendees will have a chance to give feedback to Hertz’s book before he submits the final manuscript as well as learn how to use archival resources to better understand the history of community conflict and how they can be applied to today’s gentrifying areas.

Daniel Kay Hertz(Senior Policy Analyst, Center for Tax and Budget Accountability) analyzes state and local policy issues, focusing on fiscal policy, housing, and pensions.

*Breakout Groups*

People are invited to break off into groups and work on projects, discuss potential ideas, and share their skills. Members of the Chi Hack Night community will be on site to run several of their breakout groups.

Food will be provided.
