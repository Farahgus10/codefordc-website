The [Chicago Transit Authority](http://www.transitchicago.com/) (CTA) provides bus and rail transit service to the 3.5 million people of the City of Chicago and 35 surrounding suburbs. 

How does the CTA plan and schedule to accommodate 1.6 million daily rides for changing ridership within budget and material constraints? How does the CTA get a birds eye view to internally manage operations and efficiency? And what ways are changing technologies at the CTA instigating change in data stewardship? 

To answer these questions (and more), we welcome [Lok Kwan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lok-kwan-b772603a/) from Rail Scheduling Design & Development, [Bonnie Fan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonniefan/) and [Elias Mechaber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eliasmechaber/) from Performance Management and [Bryan Post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-post-21a0842a/) from Data Analytics.
