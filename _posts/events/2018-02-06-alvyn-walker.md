On February 6, we will welcome Alvyn Walker of [Leave No Veteran Behind](https://www.leavenoveteranbehind.org/), a national non-profit organization that invests in veterans through employment training, transitional jobs, and educational debt relief scholarships. 

After his own service in the military, Al now supports veterans through workforce development programs that focus on technology training and youth mentorship. Al also contributes to collaborative community-based connectivity initiatives to set up Wi-Fi networks in Chicagoâ€™s South Shore community.

Al will talk about his work in bridging the digital divide and making technology accessible to everyone.
