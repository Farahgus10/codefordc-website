_**Update** Read the summary of this presentation on our blog: [The U.S. Government Accountability Office at Chi Hack Night](/blog/2016/09/16/us-gao.html)._

In fiscal year 2015, The federal government spent over [$3.4 trillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_States_federal_budget). Ever wonder how those taxpayer dollars were spent? 

[The U.S. Government Accountability Office](http://gao.gov/) (GAO), the federal agency known as the congressional watchdog, is tasked with supporting and advising Congress and federal agencies about ways to make government more efficient, effective, ethical, equitable and responsive.

GAO policy analysts, [Rebecca Abela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-abela-2951b457), [Silvia Ellis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silvia-ellis-5a630494), and Joanie Lofgren, will discuss the types of work GAO does to [audit the vast and diverse portfolio of federal programs and services](http://www.gao.gov/browse/topic). Often this includes analysis of publicly available data resources. The analysts will provide examples of how several such sources have been used to inform Congress and the public.
