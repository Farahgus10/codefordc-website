This week, we’re excited to have 47th Ward Alderman Ameya Pawar join us! As an Alderman, Pawar will share his experience as a local politician, particularly with regards to education, community development and the role of technology in government. As a gubernatorial candidate, he’ll share his perspective on the current challenges faced by the state.

Alderman Ameya Pawar is the son of Indian immigrants and the first Asian American to be elected onto the Chicago City Council. Since taking office in 2011 and being reelected with 82% of the vote in 2015, Ameya has secured millions of dollars for schools in his community. Ameya’s work on neighborhood schools—helping families stay in one neighborhood from kindergarten through 12th grade—is seen by many as a model for the city. 

**ASL** This event will have an American Sign Language interpreter.

**Food** Food and drinks will be provided. We encourage attendees to bring their own water bottles to reduce waste.
