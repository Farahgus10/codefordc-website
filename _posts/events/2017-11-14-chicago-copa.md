In September 2017, the City of Chicago officially launched the [Civilian Office of Police Accountability](http://www.chicagocopa.org/) (COPA), a new agency charged with oversight of the Chicago Police Department. 

COPA was formed after revelations that its predecessor, The Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), was ineffective and had failed to properly investigate or punish police misconduct based on [investigations by the Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-findings-investigation-chicago-police-department) and reporting around the [Laquan McDonald shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Laquan_McDonald).

Last week, COPA released for the first time an [open data set on the police misconduct complaints they’ve received](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/COPA-Cases-Summary/mft5-nfa8). A.D. Lewis, Martin Guzman and Mia Sissac from COPA will walk us through this data and talk about the role of transparency and open data in their work going forward.
