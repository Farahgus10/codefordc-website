The [Michigan Department of Health and Human Services](http://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs) (MDHHS) touches nearly every Michigan resident through programs and services which range from health, income and nutrition supports to advanced laboratory capabilities and state vital records. The largest of these programs support over 2.6 million Michigan residents through healthcare, nutrition, income, child care, and emergency relief services. With almost $1 Billion of allocated benefit left unclaimed each year, one of the primary barriers to services is the long and complex application. 

[Civilla](http://www.civilla.com/), a design studio in Detroit, and Chicagoâ€™s [DevMynd](https://www.devmynd.com/), partnered with residents and caseworkers to create an integrated MDHHS application that has been embraced by residents, caseworkers, and Michigan State leaders alike. 

[Lena Selzer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lenaselzer/), Design Director at Civilla and [Janice M. Cho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janice-m-cho-0572b719/), Design Director at DevMynd, will discuss how they delivered an 80% reduction in complexity (words, questions, pages) without any structural shifts in administrative rules, State laws, or Federal regulations.

**ASL** This event will have an American Sign Language interpreter.

**Food** Food and drinks will be provided. We encourage attendees to bring their own water bottles to reduce waste.
