How can government agencies get the most public good and economic value from their data assets?  

**Demand-Driven Open Data** is the [Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) approach to [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data).  It consists of a technology platform and methodology that serve as a framework for running open data initiatives in a more systematic and effective way and takes into account real world resource constraints, prioritizes work based on actual demand, and measures the value of the data assets delivered.

[David Portnoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidportnoy) has been [operating Demand-Driven Open Data at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services](http://ddod.healthdata.gov/wiki/Main_Page) since late 2014. He will review the accomplishments and lessons learned, as well as future plans for spreading this methodology to other government agencies and across presidential administrations.
