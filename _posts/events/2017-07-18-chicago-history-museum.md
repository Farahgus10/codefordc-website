Peter Alter, director of the [Chicago History Museum’s Studs Terkel Center for Oral History](https://www.chicagohistory.org/tag/oral-history/), will talk about its two most recent projects in East Garfield Park and North Lawndale. The center works with community partners to use history and oral history as empowering tools of social justice to understand ourselves and our communities.

In these projects, elementary, middle, and high school students are the historians. Alter will discuss the highlights as well as the challenges in working on these two efforts.
