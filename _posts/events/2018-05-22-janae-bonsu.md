In February 2018, the Policing in Chicago Research Group at the University of Illinois Chicago released [Tracked and Targeted](http://erasethedatabase.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Tracked-Targeted-0217.pdf), a comprehensive report detailing preliminary findings about Chicago Police Department’s (CPD) gang database. 

The report comes in coordination with a recent grassroots campaign to Defy, Defend, and Expand Sanctuary for immigrants and U.S.-born Chicagoans affected by racialized policing. After years of obscure data collection, surveillance, and predictive policing of thousands of alleged gang-affiliated individuals the campaign and this supporting research has helped illuminate how CPD’s gang database exemplifies data-driven criminalization and violates the civil rights of many Black, Hispanic, and immigrant residents.

Researcher-organizer and the report’s lead author, [Janae Bonsu](https://twitter.com/janaebonsu) will present what we know about the database, its impact, and the work behind the campaign to put an end to it.
