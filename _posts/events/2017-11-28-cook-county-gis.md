From property and boundary data, to transportation, social service, and environmental data, Cook County owns and manages a huge amount of geospatial data. This week, the County will give an exclusive preview of their new public portal for Geographic Information Systems called “Cook Central”, showcasing open spatial data, interactive mapping applications and an application programming interface for community members to pioneer unique, innovative applications with Cook County’s authoritative data. 
 
[David Arfa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-arfa-b958863) and [David Treering](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dtreering/) from the Cook County Bureau of Technology will provide an interactive walk-through of the portal, including how to find, preview, and download data by theme or category, and how to access REST endpoints for custom application development.   They will also explore the available developer resources for open source projects, as well as how to leverage ESRI’s ArcGIS platform.
