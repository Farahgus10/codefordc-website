In the fall of 2013, the City of Chicago passed the [Chicago Energy Benchmarking Ordinance](http://www.cityofchicago.org/energybenchmarking) to raise awareness of energy performance through information and transparency, with the goal of unlocking energy and cost savings opportunities for businesses and residents. 

The ordinance requires [all buildings 50,000 square feet or greater](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Chicago-Energy-Benchmarking-Covered-Buildings/g5i5-yz37) to annually measure and report energy use, and to verify their data every three years. The City is also authorized to publicly share the building-specific data.

Just over 3 years later, over 2,700 buildings have reported information, and the City [has released data for over a thousand properties](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Chicago-Energy-Benchmarking-2015-Data-Reported-in-/ebtp-548e) across every neighborhood in Chicago. 

[Amy Jewel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-jewel-12100a4) of the City Energy Project will share how energy data and transparency are being harnessed to improve energy efficiency and drive carbon reductions in the City of Chicago.
