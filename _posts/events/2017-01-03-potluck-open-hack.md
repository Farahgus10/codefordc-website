Happy New Year! Let's start 2017 off with some proper civic hacking!

There will be no presentation this week. Instead, we're going to have another civic hacking potluck! If you'd like to bring drinks, snacks or desserts, [fill out your name and what you're bringing here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fBcPpD2TF7PsDa_J8-g_-Ux5ay6tCE8Earu6llKYsXA/edit#gid=0)! We'll provide the usual empanadas too.

While we eat, we'll build, share, and learn about civic tech!
