In January 2017, The [Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR)](http://www.icirr.org/) asked Chi Hack Night's [Deportation/Immigration/Refugee Task Force breakout group](https://github.com/chihacknight/breakout-groups/issues/62) about building an app to help the immigrant community. 

After a couple iterations and fifteen months, [the app is ready to launch!](https://icirr-demo-staging.herokuapp.com/) The app will help members of the immigrant community find and access resources related to citizenship, and will serve as a compliment to the outreach being done by multiple community organizations in the area.

[Yonatan Kogan](https://twitter.com/yjkogan), the primary software engineer on the project, will talk about the process of working with ICIRR to design and build the app, the challenges that the group faced, and the lessons they learned along the way.
