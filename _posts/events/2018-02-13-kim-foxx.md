[Read more about the series here](https://chihacknight.org/blog/2018/02/02/introducing-black-history-month-speaker-series.html).*

[Cook County State's Attorney Foxx](https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/about/kimberly-foxx), who took office in 2016, will discuss her efforts to build a data program within the State's Attorney's Office, including the hiring of a Chief Data Officer and the release of a first-ever [data report](https://www.cookcountystatesattorney.org/sites/default/files/files/documents/ccsao-data-report-oct-2017.pdf). 

State's Attorney Foxx will also preview upcoming steps in the process of building towards an open data environment, including a preview of an updated data report and discussion of key challenges and decision points in the process of releasing case-level data to the public.

**Context** In 2016, Chi Hack Night circulated an [Open Data Pledge which Kim Foxx signed](/blog/2016/02/12/chi-hack-nights-open-data-pledge-for-cook-county-states-attorney.html) before being elected as Cook County State's Attorney. The work shown in this presenataion was influenced, in part, by Chi Hack Night.
