Logan Square Hack Night is a monthly civic engagement event to build, share & learn about civic tech.

Wednesday, January 31st Chi Hack Night will convene at Second Shift in Logan Square.

*Presentation*

[City Bureau](https://www.citybureau.org/) co-founder [Darryl Holliday](https://twitter.com/d_holli) and others will be on hand to talk about their work to bring journalists and community members together in collaborative environments to promote responsible media coverage, increase civic engagement and hold powerful forces to account.

They will be discussing the kinds of stories covered in Chicago over the past year, and also sharing information about their Documenters program, which pays community members an hourly wage to inform and engage their communities, and the open source technology that helps them coordinate.

*Breakout Groups*

People are invited to break off into groups and work on projects, discuss potential ideas, and share their skills. Members of the Chi Hack Night community will be on site to run several of their breakout groups.

Food will be provided.
