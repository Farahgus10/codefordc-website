    <p><strong>Chi Hack Night</strong> is a free, weekly event in Chicago to build, share and learn about tools to create, support, and serve the public good.</p>

    <p>We are a group of thousands of designers, academic researchers, data journalists, activists, policy wonks, web developers and curious citizens who want to make our city more just, equitable, transparent and delightful to live in through data, design and technology.</p>

    <h3 id='what-happens'>What happens at a hack night?</h3>
    
    <p>Chi Hack Night starts every Tuesday at 6pm. We meet in the Braintree office on the 8th floor of the Merchandise Mart in downtown Chicago. The event is free, and the invitation is open to anyone, especially folks who aren’t programmers.</p>

    <p>Here's what happens at Chi Hack Night every week:</p>

    <p><strong>6:00pm – Socializing and food</strong></p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">

            <p>As people arrive, we gather in the <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/braintree-debuts-innovative-office-january-built-brews">Braintree auditorium</a>.</p>

            <p>Because we’re meeting during the dinner hour, food is always provided, usually pizza or empanadas. We want to make sure people are happy and fed, and eating together is a great way to break the ice and bond with other attendees.</p>

    <p><strong>6:15pm – Welcome and introductions</strong></p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">

            <p>We get started around 6:15pm with a brief welcome and introduction to the event and then kick off the introductions.</p>

            <p>Everyone in the room introduces themselves and tells the group why they’re here. We’ve done this since the beginning when there were 4 of us. We still do it when there are 150 of us. As with the food, our goal is to break the ice and get people to start talking.</p>

    <p><strong>6:30pm - Announcements</strong></p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">

            <p>Next, we hold an open floor for announcements for civic tech and open government related things. This could be plugging other events, mentioning newsworthy articles and more recently, job announcements in the government and civic tech space.</p>

            <p>We record these announcements in our weekly meeting notes and agenda Google Doc. Here’s an example from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AAeAhbUKgm3J_j6E9P0x7FlNgGOOHEAqBjmtgCRPue0/edit#">Chi Hack Night #180: Covering schools through public records and data</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>6:45pm – Presentation with Q&amp;A</strong></p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">

            <p>Just about every week, we have a feature presentation that lasts about 15 minutes, with an open question &amp; answer (Q&amp;A) session after.</p>

            <p>Presenters can be any government agency, non-profit, company or group who’ve made use of open government data or built a civic technology application. Anyone can propose a talk, and I often reach out to presenters who would be a good fit. For every speaker, we provide some clear <a href="http://chihacknight.org/speaker-submissions.html">speaker guidelines</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>7:30pm – 9:30pm - “And now for the civic hacking portion of the evening”</strong></p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">

            <p>Once the presentation wraps up, the format of the event switches up to what I’d describe as a mini-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a>. People are invited to break off into groups and work on projects.</p>

            <p>As we’ve grown from just 4 attendees to 100, we’ve had to add a bit more structure to this. Anyone is welcome to start a breakout group. The only requirement is that you take ownership of the group and make an honest attempt to keep showing up every week.</p>

    <p><a href="http://chihacknight.org/breakouts.html">Breakout groups</a> that last more than a few weeks are listed on the <a href="http://chihacknight.org/">ChiHackNight.org</a> website, and are divided into two tracks: learning groups and working groups.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Learning Groups</strong> - Learning groups are for new folks (about 30% of attendees on any given week are new), those who want to learn technology skills, and discuss or refine their civic app ideas.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Working Groups</strong> - Topic-specific working groups led by facilitators to guide conversations, answer questions, and build teams for civic apps.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>When 9:30pm rolls around, we all head home and do it all over again next week.</p>
